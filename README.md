### Fibonacci Numbers
> In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,[1]
{\displaystyle F_{0}=0,\quad F_{1}=1,}{\displaystyle F_{0}=0,\quad F_{1}=1,}
and
{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}}{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}}
for n > 1.
The sequence starts:[2]
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
